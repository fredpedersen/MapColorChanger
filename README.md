MapColorChanger
===============

This is a plug in I wrote for Illustrator using the Illustrator SDK. It's just a personal project, the code is pretty messy (it's my first c++ application) and it's not well commented. If you have any questions or need any help feel free to ask!

The plugin adds a menu to illustrator called "map tools". "Create meshes from CSV" colors the mesh using data from a CSV file.
